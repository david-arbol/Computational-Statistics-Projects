# Computational-Statistics-Projects
Projects of the course Computational Statistics as part of the Double Degree of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Granada.

**Final Score of the course**: 9.8/10.

**- Project 1**: Symbolic Differentiation and Critical Point Analysis in R
Objective: This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in using the calculus R package for symbolic differentiation and the subsequent calculation of critical points for a given function.

**- Project 2**: Exam

Questions: 
  1. Statistical analysis of the iris dataset.
    
  2. Present the grade histogram exactly as requested, using the provided data. The plot should clearly display the average and quartiles. Additionally, indicate the number of people who attended and did not attend in the top-left corner of the plot.
     
  3. Plot the function given and run a montecarlo simulation to calculate the integral between 0 and 1. Compare it with the real value.

  4. Simulate the Weibull distribution with the inversion method. Run a simulation and plot it in a histogram with the theoretical and smoothed empirical density function. Perform a test to check if the simulated values follow a Weibull distribution.
